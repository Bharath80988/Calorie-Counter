1
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:13,634
You need to drink, child.

2
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,013
And eat.

3
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:26,065
Isn't there anything else?

4
00:02:27,029 --> 00:02:31,241
The Dothraki have two things
in abundance - grass and horses.

5
00:02:31,367 --> 00:02:33,573
People can't live on grass.

6
00:02:42,837 --> 00:02:45,209
In the Shadow Lands
beyond Asshai,

7
00:02:45,339 --> 00:02:47,665
they say there are fields of ghost grass

8
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,003
with stalks as pale as milk
that glow in the night.

9
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:53,544
It murders all other grass.

10
00:02:53,681 --> 00:02:56,089
The Dothraki believe that one day

11
00:02:56,225 --> 00:02:59,310
it will cover everything -
that's the way the world will end.

12
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,158
It'll get easier.

13
00:03:52,531 --> 00:03:53,907
Khaleesi!

14
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:55,860
Your hands.

15
00:04:06,587 --> 00:04:09,422
We're still not far from Pentos,
Your Grace.

16
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,921
Master Illyrio has
extended his hospitality.

17
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:13,711
You'd be more comfortable there.

18
00:04:13,844 --> 00:04:16,596
I have no interest
in hospitality or comfort.

19
00:04:16,722 --> 00:04:20,969
I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfills his end
of the bargain and I have my crown.

20
00:04:21,102 --> 00:04:23,344
As you wish, Your Grace.

21
00:04:24,355 --> 00:04:26,727
Well, Mormont,
as brutish as this life is,

22
00:04:26,857 --> 00:04:29,016
I suppose it is preferable to beheading.

23
00:04:30,695 --> 00:04:32,687
What did Ned Stark want you for?

24
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:35,982
Buying from a slaver?

25
00:04:36,117 --> 00:04:38,026
Selling to one.

26
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,070
Some poachers I caught on my land.

27
00:04:41,872 --> 00:04:45,573
Under my reign, you won't be punished
for such nonsense.

28
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,536
You can rest assured of that.

29
00:05:12,403 --> 00:05:14,811
Better-looking bitches
than you're used to, Uncle.

30
00:05:19,493 --> 00:05:21,652
My mother's been looking for you.

31
00:05:21,787 --> 00:05:23,946
We ride for King's Landing today.

32
00:05:24,665 --> 00:05:27,037
Before you go, you will call
on Lord and Lady Stark

33
00:05:27,168 --> 00:05:29,457
and offer your sympathies.

34
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:32,001
What good will my sympathies do them?

35
00:05:33,758 --> 00:05:36,712
None. But it is expected of you.

36
00:05:36,844 --> 00:05:38,753
Your absence has already been noted.

37
00:05:38,888 --> 00:05:40,845
The boy means nothing to me.

38
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:43,299
And I can't stand
the wailing of women.

39
00:05:45,603 --> 00:05:47,430
One word and I'll hit you again.

40
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:49,146
I'm telling Mother!

41
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:52,605
Go! Tell her.

42
00:05:52,777 --> 00:05:54,816
But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark

43
00:05:54,946 --> 00:05:56,855
and you will fall on your knees
in front of them

44
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:59,776
and tell them how very sorry you are,
that you are at their service,

45
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:03,112
and that all your prayers are with them.
Do you understand?

46
00:06:03,246 --> 00:06:05,404
You can't...

47
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:06,992
Do you understand?

48
00:06:13,965 --> 00:06:16,041
The Prince will
remember that, little lord.

49
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:18,084
I hope so.

50
00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:21,504
If he forgets, be a good dog
and remind him.

51
00:06:24,392 --> 00:06:27,428
Ah. Time for breakfast.

52
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:37,605
Bread. And two of those little fish.

53
00:06:37,738 --> 00:06:41,024
And a mug of dark beer
to wash it down.

54
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,695
And bacon, burnt black.

55
00:06:45,871 --> 00:06:47,698
Hyah.

56
00:06:47,873 --> 00:06:50,661
- Little brother.
- Beloved siblings.

57
00:06:55,172 --> 00:06:57,046
Is Bran going to die?

58
00:06:58,968 --> 00:07:00,047
Apparently not.

59
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:06,758
- What do you mean?
- The maester says the boy may live.

60
00:07:15,026 --> 00:07:17,943
It's no mercy, letting a child
linger in such pain.

61
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,778
Only the gods know for certain.

62
00:07:19,947 --> 00:07:22,319
All the rest of us can do is pray.

63
00:07:23,784 --> 00:07:26,358
The charms of the North
seem entirely lost on you.

64
00:07:26,495 --> 00:07:28,155
I still can't believe you're going.

65
00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:30,328
It's ridiculous, even for you.

66
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,166
Where's your sense of wonder?

67
00:07:32,293 --> 00:07:36,373
The greatest structure ever built,
the intrepid men of the Night's Watch,

68
00:07:36,505 --> 00:07:38,712
the wintry abode of the white walkers.

69
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:41,961
Tell me you're not thinking
of taking the black.

70
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:44,965
And go celibate?
The whores would go begging

71
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:46,971
from Dorne to Casterly Rock.

72
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,175
No, I just want to stand
on top of the Wall

73
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,101
and piss off the edge of the world.

74
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,178
The children don't need to hear your filth.

75
00:07:57,151 --> 00:07:58,811
Come.

76
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:08,652
Even if the boy lives,
he'll be a cripple, a grotesque.

77
00:08:08,746 --> 00:08:11,237
Give me a good, clean death any day.

78
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:16,118
Speaking for the grotesques,
I'd have to disagree.

79
00:08:16,254 --> 00:08:18,958
Death is so final, whereas life...

80
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:21,290
ah, life is full of possibilities.

81
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:26,882
I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very
interested to hear what he has to say.

82
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:31,302
My dear brother,

83
00:08:31,435 --> 00:08:34,105
there are times you make me wonder
whose side you're on.

84
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,353
My dear brother, you wound me.

85
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:38,890
You know how much
I love my family.

86
00:08:58,379 --> 00:08:59,494
Please.

87
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:02,880
Oh, I would have dressed, Your Grace.

88
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,334
This is your home. I'm your guest.

89
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:10,721
Handsome one, isn't he?

90
00:09:11,434 --> 00:09:15,930
I lost my first boy,
a little black-haired beauty.

91
00:09:16,063 --> 00:09:17,937
He was a fighter too -

92
00:09:18,065 --> 00:09:20,141
tried to beat the fever that took him.

93
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:24,271
Forgive me.

94
00:09:24,405 --> 00:09:26,279
It's the last thing you
need to hear right now.

95
00:09:26,407 --> 00:09:28,400
I never knew.

96
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,408
It was years ago.

97
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:35,412
Robert was crazed,
beat his hands bloody on the wall,

98
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,875
all the things men do
to show you how much they care.

99
00:09:43,841 --> 00:09:45,881
The boy looked just like him.

100
00:09:47,678 --> 00:09:49,386
Such a little thing.

101
00:09:50,598 --> 00:09:52,591
A bird without feathers.

102
00:09:55,478 --> 00:09:57,767
They came to take his body away

103
00:09:58,773 --> 00:10:02,521
and Robert held me.
I screamed and I battled, but he held me.

104
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:09,567
That little bundle.

105
00:10:11,535 --> 00:10:13,777
They took him away
and I never saw him again.

106
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:16,202
Never have visited the crypt, never.

107
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:28,884
I pray to the Mother
every morning and night

108
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,093
that she return your child to you.

109
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,932
I am grateful.

110
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,886
Perhaps this time she'll listen.

111
00:11:30,114 --> 00:11:32,023
A sword for the Wall?

112
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,201
- I already have one.
- Good man.

113
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:39,033
- Have you swung it yet?
- Of course I have.

114
00:11:39,123 --> 00:11:40,665
At someone, I mean.

115
00:11:45,296 --> 00:11:48,795
It's a strange thing,
the first time you cut a man.

116
00:11:48,925 --> 00:11:52,091
You realise we're nothing
but sacks of meat and blood,

117
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:55,013
and some bone to keep it all standing.

118
00:11:57,308 --> 00:11:59,347
Let me thank you ahead of time

119
00:11:59,477 --> 00:12:02,228
for guarding us all from the perils
beyond the Wall -

120
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:04,893
wildlings and white walkers
and whatnot.

121
00:12:07,109 --> 00:12:11,107
We're grateful to have good, strong men
like you protecting us.

122
00:12:13,783 --> 00:12:16,321
We've guarded the Kingdoms
for 8,000 years.

123
00:12:19,413 --> 00:12:21,572
Is it "we" already?

124
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:24,537
Have you taken your vows, then?

125
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,086
Soon enough.

126
00:12:28,506 --> 00:12:30,748
Give my regards to the Night's Watch.

127
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:34,928
I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve
in such an elite force. And if not...

128
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,346
it's only for life.

129
00:12:57,785 --> 00:12:59,778
Thank you, Nymeria.

130
00:13:07,211 --> 00:13:09,500
Septa Mordane says
I have to do it again.

131
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,335
My things weren't
properly folded, she says.

132
00:13:12,466 --> 00:13:15,420
Who cares how they're folded?
They're going to get all messed up anyway.

133
00:13:15,553 --> 00:13:17,711
It's good you've got help.

134
00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:19,431
Watch.

135
00:13:19,557 --> 00:13:21,466
Nymeria, gloves.

136
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,896
- Impressive.
- Shut up.

137
00:13:30,026 --> 00:13:31,983
Nymeria, gloves!

138
00:13:34,238 --> 00:13:36,147
I have something for you.

139
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,565
And it has to be packed very carefully.

140
00:13:39,243 --> 00:13:40,274
A present?

141
00:13:40,411 --> 00:13:42,368
Close the door.

142
00:13:54,842 --> 00:13:57,298
This is no toy.

143
00:14:00,014 --> 00:14:02,766
Be careful you don't cut yourself.

144
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:07,720
- It's so skinny.
- So are you.

145
00:14:09,106 --> 00:14:10,898
I had the blacksmith
make it for you special.

146
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:12,265
It won't hack a man's head off,

147
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,269
but it can poke him full of holes
if you're quick enough.

148
00:14:14,362 --> 00:14:17,066
- I can be quick.
- You'll have to work at it every day.

149
00:14:18,532 --> 00:14:19,991
How does it feel?

150
00:14:20,868 --> 00:14:23,193
Do you like the balance?

151
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,788
I think so.

152
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,662
First lesson - stick them with the pointy end.

153
00:14:28,793 --> 00:14:30,666
I know which end to use.

154
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:38,253
I'm going to miss you.

155
00:14:39,887 --> 00:14:41,216
Careful.

156
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:55,402
All the best swords have names, you know.

157
00:14:58,656 --> 00:15:00,649
Sansa can keep her sewing needles.

158
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,361
I've got a needle of my own.

159
00:15:19,302 --> 00:15:21,211
I came to say goodbye to Bran.

160
00:15:21,345 --> 00:15:22,923
You've said it.

161
00:15:33,816 --> 00:15:36,651
I wish I could be here when you wake up.

162
00:15:39,989 --> 00:15:42,480
I'm going north with Uncle Benjen.

163
00:15:42,617 --> 00:15:43,945
I'm taking the black.

164
00:15:53,002 --> 00:15:55,707
I know we always talked about
seeing the Wall together,

165
00:15:55,838 --> 00:15:59,503
but you'll be able to come visit me
at Castle Black when you're better.

166
00:16:01,552 --> 00:16:04,090
I'll know my way around by then.

167
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,552
I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch.

168
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:14,641
We can go out walking beyond the Wall,
if you're not afraid.

169
00:16:29,413 --> 00:16:32,201
I want you...

170
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,999
to leave.

171
00:17:33,603 --> 00:17:35,263
17 years ago

172
00:17:35,396 --> 00:17:37,804
you rode off with Robert Baratheon.

173
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:43,359
You came back a year later
with another woman's son.

174
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:47,604
And now you're leaving again.

175
00:17:50,328 --> 00:17:52,036
I have no choice.

176
00:17:52,163 --> 00:17:56,030
That's what men always say
when honour calls.

177
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:59,500
That's what you tell your families,
tell yourselves.

178
00:18:01,339 --> 00:18:03,497
You do have a choice.

179
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:06,176
And you've made it.

180
00:18:10,765 --> 00:18:12,259
Cat...

181
00:18:17,355 --> 00:18:19,810
I can't do it, Ned.

182
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,734
I really can't.

183
00:18:24,862 --> 00:18:26,321
You can.

184
00:18:28,866 --> 00:18:30,029
You must.

185
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:56,339
You've said goodbye to Bran?

186
00:18:56,477 --> 00:18:58,470
He's not going to die. I know it.

187
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:00,763
You Starks are hard to kill.

188
00:19:01,857 --> 00:19:03,316
My mother?

189
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:05,980
- She was very kind.
- Good.

190
00:19:07,863 --> 00:19:09,986
Next time I see you,
you'll be all in black.

191
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:12,192
It was always my colour.

192
00:19:13,411 --> 00:19:15,154
Farewell, Snow.

193
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:16,912
And you, Stark.

194
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:11,457
There's great honour serving
in the Night's Watch.

195
00:20:13,638 --> 00:20:17,089
The Starks have manned the Wall
for thousands of years.

196
00:20:18,142 --> 00:20:20,016
And you are a Stark.

197
00:20:20,144 --> 00:20:22,220
You might not have my name,

198
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:24,347
but you have my blood.

199
00:20:30,988 --> 00:20:32,981
Is my mother alive?

200
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:37,282
Does she know about me?
Where I am, where I'm going?

201
00:20:38,329 --> 00:20:39,989
Does she care?

202
00:20:41,332 --> 00:20:44,286
The next time we see each other,

203
00:20:44,418 --> 00:20:46,458
we'll talk about your mother.

204
00:20:46,587 --> 00:20:48,331
Hmm?

205
00:20:48,464 --> 00:20:49,923
I promise.

206
00:21:29,714 --> 00:21:32,501
Gods, this is country!

207
00:21:34,552 --> 00:21:37,802
I've half a mind to leave them
all behind and keep going.

208
00:21:40,057 --> 00:21:42,264
I've half a mind to go with you.

209
00:21:42,393 --> 00:21:47,055
What do you say, just you and me
on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides,

210
00:21:47,231 --> 00:21:50,517
a couple of tavern wenches
to warm our beds tonight.

211
00:21:50,651 --> 00:21:53,321
You should have asked me 20 years ago.

212
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:56,197
There were wars to fight,
women to marry -

213
00:21:56,324 --> 00:21:58,565
we never had the chance to be young.

214
00:21:58,701 --> 00:22:00,326
I recall a few chances.

215
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,828
There was that one...
Oh, what was her name?

216
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:08,868
That common girl of yours?

217
00:22:09,003 --> 00:22:11,790
Becca. With the great big tits
you could bury your face in.

218
00:22:11,923 --> 00:22:14,081
Bessie.
She was one of yours.

219
00:22:14,258 --> 00:22:17,923
Bessie!
Thank the gods for Bessie.

220
00:22:18,054 --> 00:22:19,631
And her tits.

221
00:22:20,681 --> 00:22:23,089
Yours was, er... Aleena?

222
00:22:23,226 --> 00:22:26,096
No. You told me once. Er... Meryl?

223
00:22:26,229 --> 00:22:28,138
Your bastard's mother?

224
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:32,141
- Wylla.
- That's it.

225
00:22:32,276 --> 00:22:34,352
She must have been a rare wench

226
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:37,357
to make Lord Eddard Stark
forget his honour.

227
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,529
You never told me what she looked like.

228
00:22:40,618 --> 00:22:41,816
Nor will I.

229
00:22:44,455 --> 00:22:46,329
We were at war.

230
00:22:46,457 --> 00:22:49,209
None of us knew if we were
gonna go back home again.

231
00:22:49,377 --> 00:22:52,378
You're too hard on yourself.
You always have been.

232
00:22:54,465 --> 00:22:57,549
I swear if I weren't your king,
you'd have hit me already.

233
00:22:57,677 --> 00:23:01,010
The worst thing about your coronation -

234
00:23:01,138 --> 00:23:03,131
I'll never get to hit you again.

235
00:23:05,476 --> 00:23:07,932
Trust me, that's not the worst thing.

236
00:23:11,983 --> 00:23:13,940
There was a rider in the night.

237
00:23:20,074 --> 00:23:23,525
Daenerys Targaryen has wed
some Dothraki horselord.

238
00:23:23,661 --> 00:23:25,488
What of it? Do we send her
a wedding gift?

239
00:23:25,621 --> 00:23:27,910
A knife perhaps, a good, sharp one,

240
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,033
and a bold man to wield it.

241
00:23:30,167 --> 00:23:31,959
She's little more than a child.

242
00:23:32,086 --> 00:23:35,289
Soon enough that child will spread her legs
and start breeding.

243
00:23:35,464 --> 00:23:39,083
- Tell me we're not speaking of this.
- Oh, it's unspeakable to you?

244
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:42,504
What her father did to your family -
that was unspeakable.

245
00:23:42,638 --> 00:23:44,927
What Rhaegar Targaryen
did to your sister -

246
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:47,050
the woman I loved.

247
00:23:47,184 --> 00:23:50,221
I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on.

248
00:23:50,313 --> 00:23:52,270
But you can't get your hands
on this one, can you?

249
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,013
This Khal Drogo,

250
00:23:55,151 --> 00:23:57,025
it's said he has 100,000 men
in his horde.

251
00:23:57,153 --> 00:23:59,904
Even a million Dothraki
are no threat to the realm,

252
00:24:00,031 --> 00:24:02,604
as long as they remain on the other side
of the Narrow Sea.

253
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:04,699
They have no ships, Robert.

254
00:24:04,827 --> 00:24:07,781
There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms
who call me usurper.

255
00:24:08,956 --> 00:24:12,621
If the Targaryen boy crosses
with a Dothraki horde at his back,

256
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:15,373
- the scum will join him.
- He will not cross.

257
00:24:17,006 --> 00:24:20,256
And if by chance he does,
we'll throw him back into the sea.

258
00:24:25,348 --> 00:24:27,340
There's a war coming, Ned.

259
00:24:28,476 --> 00:24:31,596
I don't know when,
I don't know who we'll be fighting,

260
00:24:31,729 --> 00:24:33,188
but it's coming.

261
00:25:45,303 --> 00:25:47,011
Sit.

262
00:25:47,138 --> 00:25:48,881
You'll be fed.

263
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:54,643
Untie them.

264
00:25:55,646 --> 00:25:58,018
Ah, rapers.

265
00:26:00,234 --> 00:26:03,983
They were given a choice, no doubt -
castration or the Wall.

266
00:26:04,113 --> 00:26:06,355
Most choose the knife.

267
00:26:11,454 --> 00:26:13,909
Not impressed by your new brothers?

268
00:26:16,918 --> 00:26:18,626
Lovely thing about the Watch -

269
00:26:18,753 --> 00:26:22,086
you discard your old family
and get a whole new one.

270
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,967
Why do you read so much?

271
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:36,220
Look at me and tell me what you see.

272
00:26:37,521 --> 00:26:39,431
Is this a trick?

273
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:43,271
What you see is a dwarf.

274
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:46,569
If I'd been born a peasant they might've
left me out in the woods to die.

275
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:50,784
Alas, I was born a Lannister
of Casterly Rock.

276
00:26:50,952 --> 00:26:52,909
Things are expected of me.

277
00:26:53,037 --> 00:26:55,445
My father was the Hand of the King
for 20 years.

278
00:26:55,581 --> 00:26:57,574
Until your brother killed that king.

279
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:07,124
Yes, until my brother killed him.

280
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,675
Life is full of these little ironies.

281
00:27:12,765 --> 00:27:15,470
My sister married the new king, and...

282
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:18,057
my repulsive nephew
will be king after him.

283
00:27:20,773 --> 00:27:23,893
I must do my part for the honour of my house.
Wouldn't you agree?

284
00:27:25,736 --> 00:27:27,610
But how?

285
00:27:27,738 --> 00:27:30,526
Well, my brother has his sword

286
00:27:30,616 --> 00:27:31,897
and I have my mind,

287
00:27:32,076 --> 00:27:36,074
and a mind needs books
like a sword needs a whetstone.

288
00:27:36,205 --> 00:27:38,827
That's why I read so much, Jon Snow.

289
00:27:43,045 --> 00:27:44,753
And you?

290
00:27:44,881 --> 00:27:47,039
What's your story, bastard?

291
00:27:49,343 --> 00:27:52,214
Ask me nicely
and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf.

292
00:27:56,309 --> 00:27:59,013
A bastard boy with nothing to inherit,

293
00:27:59,186 --> 00:28:03,599
off to join the ancient order
of the Night's Watch,

294
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,520
alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms.

295
00:28:07,653 --> 00:28:09,278
The Night's Watch protects
the realm from...

296
00:28:09,405 --> 00:28:12,691
Ah, yes, yes, against
grumpkins and snarks

297
00:28:12,825 --> 00:28:16,360
and all the other monsters
your wet nurse warned you about.

298
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:18,737
You're a smart boy.

299
00:28:18,873 --> 00:28:21,328
You don't believe that nonsense.

300
00:28:28,883 --> 00:28:31,753
Everything's better
with some wine in the belly.

301
00:29:06,379 --> 00:29:10,376
It's time we reviewed
the accounts, my lady.

302
00:29:10,508 --> 00:29:14,292
You'll want to know how much
this royal visit has cost us.

303
00:29:15,805 --> 00:29:17,797
Talk to Poole about it.

304
00:29:19,809 --> 00:29:23,012
Poole went south
with Lord Stark, my lady.

305
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,678
We need a new steward,

306
00:29:25,815 --> 00:29:28,851
and there are several other
appointments that require

307
00:29:28,985 --> 00:29:32,852
- our immediate attention.
- I don't care about appointments!

308
00:29:34,156 --> 00:29:36,114
I'll make the appointments.

309
00:29:38,995 --> 00:29:40,868
We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.

310
00:29:40,997 --> 00:29:42,989
Very good, my lord.

311
00:29:45,293 --> 00:29:46,751
My lady.

312
00:29:59,891 --> 00:30:02,049
When was the last time you left this room?

313
00:30:03,436 --> 00:30:04,681
I have to take care of him.

314
00:30:04,812 --> 00:30:06,520
He's not going to die, Mother.

315
00:30:06,647 --> 00:30:08,439
Maester Luwin says the most
dangerous time has passed.

316
00:30:08,566 --> 00:30:09,597
What if he's wrong?

317
00:30:09,734 --> 00:30:13,103
- Bran needs me.
- Rickon needs you.

318
00:30:14,113 --> 00:30:15,940
He's six.

319
00:30:16,073 --> 00:30:19,277
He doesn't know what's happening.
He follows me around all day,

320
00:30:19,452 --> 00:30:21,740
- clutching my leg, crying...
- Close the windows!

321
00:30:21,871 --> 00:30:23,863
I can't stand it!
Please make them stop!

322
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:29,204
Fire.

323
00:30:30,379 --> 00:30:32,502
You stay here. I'll come back.

324
00:30:50,608 --> 00:30:52,731
You're not supposed to be here.

325
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,434
No one is supposed to be here.

326
00:30:55,988 --> 00:30:57,862
It's a mercy.

327
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,817
He's dead already.

328
00:31:01,786 --> 00:31:03,280
No!

329
00:32:10,438 --> 00:32:14,103
- Have you ever seen a dragon?
- Dragon gone, Khaleesi.

330
00:32:14,859 --> 00:32:17,101
Everywhere? Even in the East?

331
00:32:17,194 --> 00:32:20,195
No dragon. Brave men kill them.

332
00:32:20,865 --> 00:32:23,237
- It is known.
- It is known.

333
00:32:23,367 --> 00:32:27,235
A trader from Qarth told me
that dragons come from the moon.

334
00:32:27,371 --> 00:32:29,494
The moon?

335
00:32:29,624 --> 00:32:32,245
He told me the moon
was an egg, Khaleesi,

336
00:32:32,376 --> 00:32:34,950
that once there were two moons in the sky.

337
00:32:35,087 --> 00:32:39,002
But one wandered too close to the sun
and it cracked from the heat,

338
00:32:39,133 --> 00:32:42,087
and out of it poured
a thousand thousand dragons

339
00:32:42,178 --> 00:32:44,052
and they drank the sun's fire.

340
00:32:44,138 --> 00:32:47,139
Moon is no egg.

341
00:32:47,225 --> 00:32:50,012
Moon is goddess - wife of sun.

342
00:32:50,144 --> 00:32:52,635
- It is known.
- It is known.

343
00:32:54,482 --> 00:32:56,106
Leave me with her.

344
00:33:04,367 --> 00:33:07,985
Why did the trader from Qarth
tell you these stories?

345
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,611
Men like to talk when they're happy.

346
00:33:10,748 --> 00:33:14,793
Before your brother bought me for you,
it was my job to make men happy.

347
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:17,163
How old were you?

348
00:33:17,255 --> 00:33:19,793
I was nine when my mother
sold me to the pleasure house.

349
00:33:19,966 --> 00:33:21,508
Nine?!

350
00:33:21,634 --> 00:33:25,548
I did not touch a man
for three years, Khaleesi.

351
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,515
First you must learn.

352
00:33:31,686 --> 00:33:34,852
Can you teach me
how to make the khal happy?

353
00:33:36,274 --> 00:33:38,065
Yes.

354
00:33:38,192 --> 00:33:39,900
Will it take three years?

355
00:33:42,029 --> 00:33:43,025
No.

356
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,171
Welcome.

357
00:35:37,186 --> 00:35:40,602
What I am about to tell you
must remain between us.

358
00:35:42,191 --> 00:35:44,682
I don't think Bran fell from that tower.

359
00:35:46,445 --> 00:35:47,940
I think he was thrown.

360
00:35:49,448 --> 00:35:52,022
The boy was always
surefooted before.

361
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:54,995
Someone tried to kill him twice.

362
00:35:55,121 --> 00:35:57,956
Why? Why murder an innocent child?

363
00:35:58,082 --> 00:36:00,751
Unless he saw something
he wasn't meant to see.

364
00:36:00,877 --> 00:36:03,498
- Saw what, my lady?
- I don't know.

365
00:36:04,964 --> 00:36:07,372
But I would stake my life
the Lannisters are involved.

366
00:36:07,508 --> 00:36:10,758
We already have reason to suspect
their loyalty to the Crown.

367
00:36:10,887 --> 00:36:13,093
Did you notice the dagger the killer used?

368
00:36:13,222 --> 00:36:15,511
It's too fine a weapon for such a man.

369
00:36:15,641 --> 00:36:18,891
The blade is Valyrian steel,
the handle dragonbone.

370
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,846
Someone gave it to him.

371
00:36:22,106 --> 00:36:25,855
They come into our home
and try to murder my brother?

372
00:36:25,985 --> 00:36:27,479
If it's war they want...

373
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:29,728
If it comes to that,
you know I'll stand behind you.

374
00:36:29,864 --> 00:36:32,984
What, is there going to be
a battle in the Godswood?

375
00:36:33,117 --> 00:36:34,611
Hmm?

376
00:36:34,744 --> 00:36:37,698
Too easily words of war
become acts of war.

377
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:39,823
We don't know the truth yet.

378
00:36:40,458 --> 00:36:42,285
Lord Stark must be told of this.

379
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:45,211
I don't trust a raven
to carry these words.

380
00:36:45,338 --> 00:36:47,211
- I'll ride to King's Landing.
- No.

381
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:50,543
There must always be a Stark in Winterfell.

382
00:36:50,635 --> 00:36:52,461
- I will go myself.
- Mother, you can't.

383
00:36:52,553 --> 00:36:54,095
I must.

384
00:36:55,223 --> 00:36:57,796
I'll send Hal with a squad
of guardsmen to escort you.

385
00:36:57,934 --> 00:37:00,389
Too large a party attracts unwanted attention.

386
00:37:00,561 --> 00:37:02,637
I don't want the Lannisters
to know I'm coming.

387
00:37:02,772 --> 00:37:04,266
Let me accompany you at least.

388
00:37:04,398 --> 00:37:07,399
The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place
for a woman alone.

389
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,569
What about Bran?

390
00:37:15,243 --> 00:37:18,113
I have prayed to the Seven
for more than a month.

391
00:37:19,455 --> 00:37:22,705
Bran's life is in their hands now.

392
00:38:21,767 --> 00:38:23,559
No, Khaleesi.

393
00:38:23,728 --> 00:38:26,515
You must look in his eyes always.

394
00:38:26,647 --> 00:38:28,723
Love comes in at the eyes.

395
00:38:30,276 --> 00:38:33,146
It is said that Irogenia of Lys
could finish a man

396
00:38:33,279 --> 00:38:35,106
with nothing but her eyes.

397
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:37,446
Finish a man?

398
00:38:39,035 --> 00:38:41,193
Oh.

399
00:38:42,371 --> 00:38:45,906
Kings travelled across the world
for a night with Irogenia.

400
00:38:46,042 --> 00:38:48,663
Magisters sold their palaces.

401
00:38:48,794 --> 00:38:52,210
Khals burned her enemies
just to have her for a few hours.

402
00:38:53,257 --> 00:38:55,879
They say a thousand men
proposed to her

403
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:59,046
and she refused them all.

404
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:02,383
Well, she sounds like
an interesting woman.

405
00:39:02,516 --> 00:39:04,176
I... I don't think

406
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:06,766
that Drogo will like it with me on top.

407
00:39:06,896 --> 00:39:09,138
You will make him like it, Khaleesi.

408
00:39:09,273 --> 00:39:11,313
Men want what they've never had.

409
00:39:11,442 --> 00:39:14,776
And the Dothraki take slaves like
a hound takes a bitch.

410
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:18,148
Are you a slave, Khaleesi?

411
00:39:29,168 --> 00:39:31,659
Then don't make love like a slave.

412
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,638
Very good, Khaleesi.

413
00:39:42,765 --> 00:39:44,758
Out there he is the mighty khal,

414
00:39:45,434 --> 00:39:48,768
but in this tent, he belongs to you.

415
00:39:49,564 --> 00:39:50,974
I... I don't think

416
00:39:51,107 --> 00:39:53,598
that this is the Dothraki way.

417
00:39:53,734 --> 00:39:55,774
If he wanted the Dothraki way,

418
00:39:56,612 --> 00:39:58,735
why did he marry you?

419
00:40:47,204 --> 00:40:48,533
No.

420
00:40:52,501 --> 00:40:53,960
No!

421
00:40:56,005 --> 00:40:58,959
Tonight I would look upon your face!

422
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:47,401
Pardon me, ser.

423
00:42:51,245 --> 00:42:53,534
Do I frighten you so much, girl?

424
00:42:55,249 --> 00:42:58,120
Or is it him there making you shake?

425
00:42:58,961 --> 00:43:00,669
He frightens me too.

426
00:43:00,796 --> 00:43:03,252
Look at that face.

427
00:43:04,175 --> 00:43:05,966
I'm sorry if I offended you, ser.

428
00:43:12,808 --> 00:43:13,757
Why won't he speak to me?

429
00:43:13,893 --> 00:43:16,847
He hasn't been very talkative
these last 20 years.

430
00:43:16,979 --> 00:43:19,933
Since the Mad King had his tongue
ripped out with hot pincers.

431
00:43:20,066 --> 00:43:22,817
He speaks damn well
with his sword though.

432
00:43:22,944 --> 00:43:26,359
Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's Justice.

433
00:43:28,032 --> 00:43:30,025
The Royal Executioner.

434
00:43:31,911 --> 00:43:34,484
What is it, sweet lady?

435
00:43:36,165 --> 00:43:38,371
Does the hound frighten you?

436
00:43:38,543 --> 00:43:40,001
Away with you, dog.

437
00:43:40,836 --> 00:43:42,544
You're scaring my lady.

438
00:43:44,882 --> 00:43:46,875
I don't like to see you upset.

439
00:43:49,512 --> 00:43:51,255
The sun's finally shining.

440
00:43:52,139 --> 00:43:53,966
Come walk with me.

441
00:43:55,101 --> 00:43:57,093
Stay, Lady.

442
00:44:13,869 --> 00:44:15,992
I probably shouldn't have any more.

443
00:44:16,122 --> 00:44:18,364
Father only lets us
have one cup at feasts.

444
00:44:18,499 --> 00:44:21,453
My princess can drink
as much as she wants.

445
00:44:34,056 --> 00:44:36,678
Don't worry. You're safe with me.

446
00:44:37,727 --> 00:44:39,719
I'll get you!

447
00:44:45,026 --> 00:44:46,686
Arya!

448
00:44:46,819 --> 00:44:47,982
Ow!

449
00:44:48,112 --> 00:44:49,772
What are you doing here?

450
00:44:49,906 --> 00:44:51,898
- Go away.
- Your sister?

451
00:44:55,786 --> 00:44:58,574
- And who are you, boy?
- Mycah, my lord.

452
00:44:58,748 --> 00:45:00,740
- He's the butcher's boy.
- He's my friend.

453
00:45:00,875 --> 00:45:04,208
A butcher's boy who wants
to be a knight, eh?

454
00:45:06,005 --> 00:45:08,578
Pick up your sword, butcher's boy.
Let's see how good you are.

455
00:45:08,758 --> 00:45:11,296
She asked me to, my lord.
She asked me to.

456
00:45:11,385 --> 00:45:15,050
I'm your prince, not your lord,

457
00:45:15,181 --> 00:45:18,929
and I said pick up your sword.

458
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:21,266
It's not a sword, my prince.
It's only a stick.

459
00:45:21,395 --> 00:45:23,222
And you're not a knight.

460
00:45:24,565 --> 00:45:26,807
Only a butcher's boy.

461
00:45:26,943 --> 00:45:29,860
That was my lady's sister you were hitting.
Do you know that?

462
00:45:29,987 --> 00:45:32,229
- Stop it!
- Arya, stay out of this.

463
00:45:32,907 --> 00:45:35,445
I won't hurt him...

464
00:45:35,534 --> 00:45:36,530
much.

465
00:45:45,169 --> 00:45:46,284
Arya!

466
00:45:47,421 --> 00:45:48,666
Filthy little bitch!

467
00:45:48,839 --> 00:45:50,631
No, no, stop it, stop it, both of you!

468
00:45:50,758 --> 00:45:53,463
You're spoiling it.
You're spoiling everything!

469
00:45:54,178 --> 00:45:56,586
I'll gut you, you little cunt!

470
00:45:59,475 --> 00:46:01,515
- Arya!
- Nymeria!

471
00:46:01,644 --> 00:46:02,509
Arya!

472
00:46:02,645 --> 00:46:04,139
Nymeria!

473
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:10,983
No.

474
00:46:11,112 --> 00:46:13,519
No. Please don't.

475
00:46:13,656 --> 00:46:15,981
Arya, leave him alone.

476
00:46:34,677 --> 00:46:38,093
My prince, my poor prince,
look what they did to you.

477
00:46:38,222 --> 00:46:40,547
Stay here. I'll go back to the inn
and bring help.

478
00:46:40,683 --> 00:46:41,846
Then go!

479
00:46:43,769 --> 00:46:46,011
Don't touch me.

480
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:51,108
The wolf's not here.
Look down by the stream.

481
00:46:57,241 --> 00:47:01,073
You've got to go. They'll kill you
for what you did to Joffrey.

482
00:47:01,203 --> 00:47:03,280
Go on. Run.

483
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,540
Go! Leave now!

484
00:47:10,922 --> 00:47:13,080
- It's a direwolf.
- I'll check down here.

485
00:47:18,971 --> 00:47:22,257
I think I heard a noise.

486
00:47:23,601 --> 00:47:25,428
Go!

487
00:47:37,657 --> 00:47:40,230
Arya!

488
00:47:41,244 --> 00:47:42,572
Arya!

489
00:47:44,247 --> 00:47:45,242
Arya!

490
00:47:45,998 --> 00:47:48,240
Arya!

491
00:47:49,502 --> 00:47:50,913
Arya!

492
00:47:51,629 --> 00:47:53,253
Arya!

493
00:47:53,381 --> 00:47:55,457
My lord!

494
00:47:55,591 --> 00:47:57,631
My Lord! They've found her.

495
00:47:57,718 --> 00:48:00,256
- She's unharmed.
-  Arya!

496
00:48:00,388 --> 00:48:02,676
- Where is she?
- She's been taken directly before the king.

497
00:48:02,807 --> 00:48:04,634
- Who took her?
- The Lannisters found her.

498
00:48:04,725 --> 00:48:06,848
- Arya!
- Right, get back.

499
00:48:06,978 --> 00:48:09,647
The queen ordered them
to bring her straight to him.

500
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:11,972
Back! Back to the inn!

501
00:48:12,984 --> 00:48:14,727
All back!

502
00:48:22,618 --> 00:48:24,410
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

503
00:48:24,537 --> 00:48:26,031
- Are you hurt?
- No.

504
00:48:26,163 --> 00:48:28,619
Oh, it's all right.

505
00:48:30,418 --> 00:48:33,087
What is the meaning of this?

506
00:48:33,254 --> 00:48:35,246
Why was my daughter
not brought to me at once?

507
00:48:35,381 --> 00:48:37,124
How dare you speak to your king
in that manner?

508
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:38,675
Quiet, woman.

509
00:48:39,927 --> 00:48:42,928
Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl.

510
00:48:43,055 --> 00:48:45,381
But we need to get
this business done quickly.

511
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:49,136
Your girl and that butcher's boy
attacked my son.

512
00:48:49,312 --> 00:48:51,435
That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.

513
00:48:51,564 --> 00:48:53,438
That's not true!

514
00:48:53,566 --> 00:48:56,104
She just... bit him a little.

515
00:48:56,944 --> 00:48:59,614
- He was hurting Mycah.
- Joff told us what happened.

516
00:48:59,739 --> 00:49:02,905
You and that boy beat him with clubs
while you set your wolf on him.

517
00:49:03,075 --> 00:49:04,570
That's not what happened!

518
00:49:04,702 --> 00:49:07,822
Yes, it is! They all attacked me
and she threw my sword in the river.

519
00:49:07,955 --> 00:49:09,118
- Liar!
- Shut up!

520
00:49:09,248 --> 00:49:10,659
Enough!

521
00:49:10,791 --> 00:49:13,709
He tells me one thing,
she tells me another.

522
00:49:13,794 --> 00:49:16,036
Seven hells!
What am I to make of this?

523
00:49:18,299 --> 00:49:21,004
- Where's your other daughter, Ned?
- In bed, asleep.

524
00:49:21,135 --> 00:49:23,128
She's not.

525
00:49:23,262 --> 00:49:25,670
Sansa, come here, darling.

526
00:49:36,692 --> 00:49:38,519
Now, child...

527
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:41,479
tell me what happened.

528
00:49:41,614 --> 00:49:43,653
Tell it all and tell it true.

529
00:49:43,783 --> 00:49:46,238
It's a great crime to lie to a king.

530
00:49:54,794 --> 00:49:56,917
I don't know.

531
00:49:57,046 --> 00:50:00,047
I don't remember.
Everything happened so fast.

532
00:50:01,133 --> 00:50:03,506
- I didn't see.
- Liar!

533
00:50:03,636 --> 00:50:05,047
- Liar, liar, liar!
- Arya!

534
00:50:05,179 --> 00:50:07,421
- Hey, stop it! That's enough of that.
- Liar, liar, liar!

535
00:50:07,598 --> 00:50:11,014
- Stop! Arya!
- She's as wild as that animal of hers.

536
00:50:11,143 --> 00:50:13,136
- I want her punished.
- What would you have me do,

537
00:50:13,271 --> 00:50:14,729
whip her through the streets?

538
00:50:14,855 --> 00:50:17,892
Damn it, children fight. It's over.

539
00:50:17,984 --> 00:50:20,653
Joffrey will bear these scars
for the rest of his life.

540
00:50:22,238 --> 00:50:25,737
You let that little girl disarm you?

541
00:50:31,956 --> 00:50:34,910
Ned, see to it that your daughter
is disciplined.

542
00:50:35,042 --> 00:50:37,829
- I'll do the same with my son.
- Gladly, Your Grace.

543
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:41,039
And what of the direwolf?

544
00:50:41,883 --> 00:50:44,255
What of the beast
that savaged your son?

545
00:50:47,346 --> 00:50:49,718
I'd forgot the damned wolf.

546
00:50:49,849 --> 00:50:52,470
We found no trace of the direwolf,
Your Grace.

547
00:50:52,643 --> 00:50:55,810
No? So be it.

548
00:50:55,938 --> 00:50:57,978
We have another wolf.

549
00:51:01,402 --> 00:51:02,980
As you will.

550
00:51:03,112 --> 00:51:06,362
- You can't mean it.
- A direwolf's no pet.

551
00:51:06,490 --> 00:51:08,649
Get her a dog.
She'll be happier for it.

552
00:51:09,952 --> 00:51:12,490
He doesn't mean Lady, does he?

553
00:51:12,663 --> 00:51:15,201
No, no, not Lady!
Lady didn't bite anyone!

554
00:51:15,333 --> 00:51:17,409
- She's good!
- Lady wasn't there!

555
00:51:17,543 --> 00:51:20,461
- You leave her alone!
- Stop them. Don't let them do it.

556
00:51:20,588 --> 00:51:22,995
Please, please, it wasn't Lady!

557
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:24,834
Is this your command?

558
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:27,421
Your Grace?

559
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:37,393
- Where is the beast?
- Chained up outside, Your Grace.

560
00:51:37,521 --> 00:51:39,479
Ser Ilyn, do me the honour.

561
00:51:39,607 --> 00:51:41,018
No.

562
00:51:42,026 --> 00:51:44,019
Jory...

563
00:51:45,488 --> 00:51:47,527
take the girls to their rooms.

564
00:51:51,869 --> 00:51:54,241
If it must be done,

565
00:51:54,372 --> 00:51:56,329
then I'll do it myself.

566
00:51:56,457 --> 00:51:58,497
Is this some trick?

567
00:51:58,626 --> 00:52:00,665
The wolf is of the North.

568
00:52:02,213 --> 00:52:04,620
She deserves better than a butcher.

569
00:52:38,124 --> 00:52:41,659
The butcher's boy -
you rode him down?

570
00:52:41,794 --> 00:52:43,787
He ran.

571
00:52:43,963 --> 00:52:45,505
Not very fast.
